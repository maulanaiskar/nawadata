1. Problem : Biggest Factor (60 Poin) (NDL005)
Given N integers, select a subset of N numbers so that we can form all numbers from 1 to (X)
Factor, use one or several numbers (one time each) from the subset. For example, using 3
numbers: 1, 2 and 3, we can form all the numbers from 1 to 6 using these 3 numbers (1, 2, 3 = 1
+ 2, 4 = 1 + 3, 5 = 2 + 3, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3). So, if you have 2 numbers: 1 and 3, even though you
can form 4 = 1 + 3, you cannot form 2, so in this case (X) Factor = 1. Your task is to find the
biggest (X) Factor that can be formed.
Input :
The first line contains N integers t1..N (1 ≤ ti ≤ 100000) which states the available numbers.
Output :
Print a single line output that contains the biggest (X) Factor value that can be formed.

2. Problem : Sort Character (50 Poin) (NDL002)
Input :
One line of words (S).
Output :
Contains vowel and consonant characters that has been sorted according to the following rules.
- Sort the letters in alphabetical order in the group.
- Separate between vowels and consonants.
- Process as lowercase letters (whitespaces are ignored)
